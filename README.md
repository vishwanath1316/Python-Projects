# Geographical Temperature Data Analysis
## Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the analysis of temperature data across different geographic locations. The project focuses on understanding how temperature varies by region and over time, utilizing a variety of data visualization techniques.

## Features
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
The notebook includes steps for cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
### Geographical Data Integration:
Merges temperature data with geographical information such as zip codes, cities, and states.
### Advanced Data Visualization:
- Utilizes both tabular data visualization (charts) and geographical mapping to present the findings.
- Stacked bar charts to show maximum temperatures for each zip code by month.
- Line charts for average temperatures per zip code over months.
- Basemap visualizations to represent temperature distributions geographically.
## Objectives
- To analyze temperature variations across different zip codes.
- To visualize temperature trends and distributions over time and across different regions.
- To identify any patterns or anomalies in temperature data in a geographical context.
## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- Basemap: For mapping and plotting geographical data.
## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Basemap.
- Open the notebook and run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
